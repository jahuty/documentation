# Documentation

Documentation for [Jahuty](https://www.jahuty.com).

This is the public repository for Jahuty's [documentation](https://docs.jahuty.com), a static website generated by Jekyll. If you find any errors in our documentation or you have suggestions, please fork this repository to submit an issue or pull request.

## Testing

To test the site in the browser with RSpec and Capybara, we'll run our static site as a Rack application in the `test` environment.

To run the tests, use `rspec` (use the `bundle exec` prefix if you have gem version issues):

```bash
~/projects/jahuty/marketing $ bundle exec rspec
```

The code above will run the `js: true` tests in a headless chrome browser. To run the tests in a visible browser window, prefix the command with `HEADLESS=false`:

```bash
~/projects/jahuty/marketing $ HEADLESS=false bundle exec rspec
```
