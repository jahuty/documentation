# Jahuty Documentation

Welcome to Jahuty! We're excited to partner with you as you use snippets to stop deploying content changes.

It only takes a few minutes to get started:

1. Create [your account](/getting-started/your-account).
2. Create (or join) [your organization](/getting-started/your-organization) in Jahuty.
3. Create [your snippet](/getting-started/your-snippet).
4. Retrieve your snippet from [your application](/getting-started/your-application).

That's it!

We've divided our documentation into the following sections, if you'd like to learn more.

* [Getting started](/getting-started/your-account) with Jahuty.
* [Learning more](/components/overview) about important components.
* [Creating templates](/liquid/introduction) with our templating language.
* [Choosing an SDK](/sdks) to interact with our API.
* [Using our API](/api) directly.

We strive to provide great documentation. If you spot an issue, let us know or fork the repo and suggest an edit!
