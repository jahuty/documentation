# Organizations

An organization is a group of people that work together in Jahuty. Everyone must belong to an organization, even if they're the only member. You can belong to many, but you must belong to at least one.

After you sign up and confirm your email, we'll require you to [create](#creating-an-organization) or [join](#joining-an-organization) an organization. It's required, because almost everything in Jahuty belongs to an organization. The things you can do in Jahuty are determined by the organizations you belong to and the role you're assigned.

If you're the first person from your organization to use Jahuty, you should create a new organization and invite others to join you. If not, you should ask your organization's administrator for an invitation to join.

##  Creating an organization

The process to create an organization differs slightly depending upon whether or not it's your first organization.

To create your first organization:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. We'll redirect you to a welcome screen.
1. Click the "Create organization" button.

To create a new organization at any time:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click your name in the top-right navigation.
1. Click "Settings" in the dropdown menu under "Organization".
1. Click "New organization" from the left navigation.

From either of those initial steps, continue to:

1. Enter your organization's name.
1. Optionally, click "invite more" link and enter the email of colleagues to invite.
1. Click the "Create organization" button.

That's it! You've created your organization; you've been assigned the [owner role](memberships#owner); and, we'll redirect you to [create a snippet](snippets#creating-a-snippet).

## Joining an organization

To join an organization:

1. Ask your organization owner in Jahuty to send you an invitation.
1. Click the link in the invitation.
1. Click the "Accept their invitation" button.

That's it! You're in.

When you accept an invitation, you're assigned the [contributor role](memberships#contributor), which has limited access to things like invitations, API keys, etc.
