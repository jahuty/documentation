{% include heading.html title="Organizations" lead="A group of people that work together in Jahuty." %}

An _organization_ is a group of people that work together in Jahuty. Almost everything in Jahuty belongs to an organization, including your account. The organizations you belong to and the roles you are assigned within them determine what you can do in Jahuty. You can belong to more than one organization, but you must belong to at least one, even if you're the only member.

## Viewing organizations

You may belong to more than one organization, but only one can be active at a time. The name of the current organization is always visible in the left navigation.

To switch organizations:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click the chevron-down icon (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) next to your organization's name in the left navigation.
1. Find the name of the organization you would like to switch to in the dropdown.
1. Click the name of the organization.

To view more information about your organizations, you can [view your memberships]({% link components/memberships.md %}#viewing-memberships).

## Creating organizations

When you create your account, we'll create an organization entitled, "My organization", for you. You can use this organization as your primary organization and invite others to join you, or you can use it as a test area when you join another.

1. Click the chevron-down icon (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) next to your organization's name in the left navigation.
1. Click the _New organization_ link.
1. Fill in the organization's name.
1. Click the _Add coworkers and colleagues_ button, if you'd like to send invitations now (you can always do so later).
1. Click the _Create organization_ button.

## Updating organizations

To update your organization's information:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click the chevron-down icon (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) next to your organization's name in the left navigation.
1. Click the _Settings_ link.
1. Change the organization's name.
