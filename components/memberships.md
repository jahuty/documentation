## Roles

As a member of an organization, you're assigned a role that determines what you can do on behalf of the organization. When you create an organization, you are automatically assigned the _owner_ role, which is the top-most role. You can do just about anything on behalf of the organization.

### Owner

Owners are the top-most role, and you can do just about anything on behalf of the organization.

### Contributor

Contributors have limited access to things like invitations, API keys, etc.



## Managing members

Members of an organization share snippets and a billing account.

It's important to keep your organization's members up-to-date as your organization changes in the real world. For example, if an employee leaves your organization and you don't remove them in Jahuty, they'll have access to your snippets, if they have access to their password.
