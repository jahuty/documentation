{% include heading.html title="Memberships" lead="Your memberships, and the roles you are assigned, determine what you can do in Jahuty." %}

Your _memberships_, the organizations you belong to and the roles you are assigned within them, determine what you can do in Jahuty. You can belong to more than one organization, but you must belong to at least one, even if you're the only member.

## Viewing memberships

To view your memberships:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click the chevron-down icon (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) next to your name in the left navigation.
1. Click the _Settings_ link in the dropdown.
1. Click the _Memberships_ link in in the left navigation.

We'll call this your "Memberships dashboard", and the rest of this article will assume you're starting here.

## Roles

As a member of an organization, you're assigned a role that determines what you can do on behalf of the organization. When you create an organization, you are automatically assigned the _owner_ role. When you accept an invitation, on the other hand, you are automatically assigned the _contributor_ role.

## Deleting memberships

At this time, you cannot delete a membership through the application. Instead, please [contact us]({{ site.data.urls.contact }}) for assistance.
