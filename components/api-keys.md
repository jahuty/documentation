{% include heading.html title="API Keys" lead="Long, impossible-to-guess strings that identify your organization's API requests." %}

[API keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key) are long, impossible-to-guess strings of letters and numbers that Jahuty uses to identify your organization's API requests. If you do not include a key when making an [API request](/api#authentication), you include one incorrectly, or use one that is incorrect or outdated, Jahuty will return an error.

## Types of API keys

There are two types of API keys: _public_ and _secret_.

* **Public** API keys are meant solely to identify your organization's account with Jahuty and have limited permissions. They arenâ€™t secret. In other words, they can safely be published in places like your JavaScript SDK, or in an Android or iPhone app.
* **Secret** API keys, on the other hand, should be kept confidential, stored on your own servers, and only used in a server-side SDK. Secret API keys are secret, because they can perform more API requests than a _public_ one.

Every organization is provided with a public "Default API Key" on account creation.

## Obtaining your API keys

Your organization's API keys are available in its dashboard:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click the dropdown in the top-right of the navigation.
1. Click the "Settings" link in the "Organization" section of the the dropdown menu.
1. Click the "API keys" link in the left navigation.

## Securing your API keys

Take care to keep your _secret_ API keys secure. They can be used to make API calls on behalf of your account, and publicly exposing your secret credentials can result in your account being compromised. Treat your secret API key as you would any other password.

To help keep your API keys secure, follow these best practices:

* Ensure keys are kept out of your version control system. If you store API keys in files, keep the files outside your application's source tree. Otherwise, anyone with access to your repository - contributors, vendors, etc -  has access to your keys.
* Give each integration its own API key, and name each key so you know which key goes with which application. If a specific API key is compromised, you can disable that key without disabling access to all of your other integrations.
* Grant access to your keys only to those who need it using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers) or [secrets management service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management#Non-KMIP-compliant_key_management).
* Be careful not to expose the key to the public (such as in screenshots, videos, or help documentation). Remember that blurring your data isn't always enough.
* If a key needs to be shared, generate a new key and name it accordingly so it can be disabled, if needed. Never email the API key, because it would allow access to your Jahuty account if hackers were to compromise your email account.
* Roll your API keys periodically and update your applications to use the newly-generated keys. Your old keys will continue to work for 12 hours after you generate replacement keys.
* Delete unneeded API keys to minimize exposure to attacks.

## Creating an API key

To create an API key:

1. [Sign in]({{ site.data.urls.app.sign_in }}) to your account.
1. Click the dropdown in the top-right of the navigation.
1. Click the "Settings" link in the "Organization" section of the the dropdown menu.
1. Click the "API keys" link in the left navigation.
1. Click the "New API key" button in the top-right of the screen.
1. Enter the API key's name to help distinguish it from your other keys.
1. Enter an expiration date, if you like (by default, keys don't expire until rolled or deleted).
1. Click the "Save API key" button, and we'll add the new key to your table of keys.
1. Copy the key's token to your computer and paste it where it's needed.

## Rolling your API keys

Periodically refreshing your API keys makes your application a moving target and disables any keys which may have been compromised without your knowledge. Rolling an API keys gives you a 12-hour window to update your application to use a newly-generated key before the old one expires.

To roll an API key, click the ellipsis icon ("...") beside the key and select "Roll" from the dropdown menu.

## Deleting your API keys

If an API key is no longer needed (or you suspect it's been compromised), you should delete it. Deleting a key immediately revokes its access and any further use will return an error.

To delete an API key, click the ellipsis icon ("...") beside the key and select "Delete" from the dropdown menu.
