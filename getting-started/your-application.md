# Getting started with your application

Jahuty is designed to be application agnostic, and it should work equally well in an MVC, SPA, or legacy application.

When a snippet is created, it's assigned an `id`, a unique, permanent, integer identifier. This is the identifier you'll use to retrieve a snippet for display in your application.

A number of [software development kits (SDKs)](/sdks) are available to make interacting with our API easier. We maintain these open-source packages in a number of languages, and you can choose the one that fits your stack.

If an SDK is not available in your language of choice, you can access [our API](/api) directly.
