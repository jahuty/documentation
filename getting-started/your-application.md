# Getting started with your application

Now that you've created a snippet, you're ready to retrieve it.

When a snippet is created, it's assigned a unique, permanent, integer identifier (aka, `id`). This is the identifier you'll use to retrieve it for display in your application.

A number of [software development kits (SDKs)](/sdks) are available to make interacting with our API easier. We maintain these open-source packages in a number of languages, and you can choose the one that fits your stack. If an SDK is not available in your language of choice, you can also access [our API](/api) directly.

To use an SDK or our API, you'll need an [API key](/components/api-keys) to identify your organization's requests. If you created an organization, we emailed you a temporary one with limited permissions that will expire at the end of your free trial.
